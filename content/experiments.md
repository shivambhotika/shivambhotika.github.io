## Active Projects

**[AI Explained For Plebs](https://aiexplainedforplebs.vercel.app/)**  
ChatGPT for people who still call it "the ChatGPT." Teaching your parents what tokens are since 2024.

**[Garam VC](https://garam-vc.vercel.app/#/leaderboard)**  
Tinder for VCs, but everyone swipes left. Built because someone needed to rank India's investors by vibes and clout.

**[Dhan Ki Baat](https://www.dhankibaat.xyz/)**  
Because every tech bro with their first equity thinks they're the next Buffett. A reality check disguised as an investment planner.
