  following rabbit holes on how to enhance the physical world with robots.

Based in Berlin. I try to map today's hardware and robotics wave to the physical world markets they're going to serve. 

A bunch of links to get started with some stuff I do:


- [99.5% of hardware companies don't know what venture capital is](/thoughts/hardware-co-without-VC)
- [Builders Take All, my substack newsletter](https://gabrieletinelli.substack.com)
- [BitBuilders, my podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1y5r74qzatrFOaxGbDf6iA)

I made this website [open source](https://github.com/gabtin/gabtin.github.io). 
It's based on Obsidian and it could be useful to fork to some PKM nerds.

I'm usually at gabriele@foundamental.com.
