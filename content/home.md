Based in Bengaluru / Calcutta. I'm interested in ideas that feel slightly early, slightly irrational, and somehow inevitable in hindsight; especially around AI, consumer behavior, and the weird edges of the internet.

A bunch of links to get started with some stuff I do:

- [OuterSpeak, my substack newsletter](https://outerspeak.substack.com)
- [The Token Dispatch](https://www.thetokendispatch.com) - 200K+ subscribers, top #20 crypto newsletter on Substack
- [Oftenly Wicked Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/03xnDBxIRYdMWdyzRlQUBF) - did podcasting before it was cool

This site is a living notebook more than a finished product. Some things are polished, some are experiments, all of it is part of the same ongoing thought process.

I made this website [open source](https://github.com/shivambhotika/shivambhotika.github.io). 
It's based on Obsidian and it could be useful to fork to some PKM nerds.

You can usually find me at shivam.bhotika@gmail.com.
