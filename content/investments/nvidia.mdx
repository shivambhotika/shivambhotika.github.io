NVIDIA has built an extraordinary moat in accelerated computing. Their CUDA ecosystem creates massive switching costs, and they continue to extend their lead with each generation of hardware.

The AI training and inference market is still in early innings. As models get larger and more capable, demand for compute will only increase.

Risks: Competition from AMD, Intel, and custom chips from hyperscalers. Valuation assumes continued dominance.
