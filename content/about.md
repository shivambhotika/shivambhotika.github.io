Gabriele. Berlin-based. Southern-italian. From [this tiny town](https://www.google.com/maps/search/NOCI,%20BA). 

Aerospace engineer by training, investor at [Foundamental](https://www.foundamental.com/) - where I look for hardware and robotics businesses that will either (1) become the next generation of universal tooling for their industry or (2) perform $100B+ in physical work over the next decade.

I was born in a family of two music teachers. My grandpa (on the right) was a great plumber and grew more veggies than my grandma could ever cook. My grandma (on the left) is a literal superhero who raised 3 girls on her own.

I try to get out and climb as much as I can. This is me on [Uomini e Topi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf1MWu2R7P8), in the [Mello Valley](https://www.valmasino.info/en/schede/mello-valley/).

I'll use this website as a personal repo for my thoughts and my interests.
