I spend most of my time somewhere between early-stage venture, startup building, and writing things that probably didn't need to be written but felt important anyway. Over the last few years, I've worked inside funds, helped companies go from zero to something slightly less chaotic, and built side projects that occasionally escape into the wild.

I like work that starts out unstructured — the kind where no one really knows the playbook yet. Sometimes that means helping founders think through product or growth, sometimes it means building tools, and sometimes it means writing to make sense of what's changing across tech, culture, and markets.

I'm generally interested in ideas that feel a little early, a little strange, and just credible enough to pursue.

I'll use this website as a personal repo for my thoughts and my interests.
