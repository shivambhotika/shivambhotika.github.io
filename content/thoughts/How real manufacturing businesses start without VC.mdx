For years, "hardware is hard" was the prevailing wisdom in venture capital. Software ate the world, and physical products were seen as capital-intensive, margin-compressed, and slow to iterate.

But something is shifting.

## Why Now?

Several converging trends make hardware more viable:

1. **AI/ML capabilities** - Suddenly robots can see, understand, and adapt
2. **Supply chain maturity** - Contract manufacturing has gotten much better
3. **Capital availability** - More investors willing to fund deep tech
4. **Software-hardware convergence** - The best hardware companies are really software companies

## The Opportunity

The physical world is still largely untouched by automation. Warehouses, construction sites, farms, hospitals - these environments are ripe for robotics and automation.

The companies that figure out how to deploy capable, reliable robots in these environments will capture enormous value.
